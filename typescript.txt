TYPESCRIPT TUTORIAL

what is typescript ?

-alternative language to javascript, it's a superset of javascript language which means it extends the language with new features and syntax.

-browsers by default don't understand typescript like they do javascript, so we have to compile it into javascript first in order for browsers to understand it.

-javascript with types

-first significant features is possibility of using strict types, which means that we can't change previously declared type of a value, error checking process is more practical and the code is cleaner

-it supports modern features of js like arrow funcs and let/const, it can translate to older javascript code which doesn't support these features

-it has some extra features, like generics, interfaces, tuples etc.

project for this practice will be a simple finance logger to notify dynamic payments and invoices

we need to install typescript compiler

in main command prompt: 
npm i -g typescript 

part 1: compiling typescript

have some html & css code prepared

to simply compile typescript code, type next thing in terminal:
tsc main.ts main.js
if the files are of the same name you can simply type:
tsc main.ts

there is an error that appears after compiling ts code, but this error doesn't affect anything 'cause it's from a typescript file and that file never appears itself in a real code
